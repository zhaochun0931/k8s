A Kubernetes Operator is a custom controller that manages an application or system running inside Kubernetes—just like the built-in controllers (Deployment controller, StatefulSet controller, Job controller), but customized for your app.

Operators let you teach Kubernetes:

“When this kind of resource exists, automatically maintain, upgrade, scale, or heal it.”



🚀 What is a Kubernetes Operator?

A Kubernetes Operator consists of:

CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)

    Defines a new API type, e.g. MyApp, Database, CacheCluster

Controller

    Watches for changes to that resource (using reconciliation loop)

    Performs actions (create Pods, Services, configs, backup, restore, etc)

Think of an Operator as:

CRD + Controller logic = Operator
