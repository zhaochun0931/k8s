The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. 




The kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready.




The kubelet uses startup probes to know when a container application has started. If such a probe is configured, liveness and readiness probes do not start until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup.





liveness.yaml

In the configuration file, you can see that the Pod has a single Container. 
The periodSeconds field specifies that the kubelet should perform a liveness probe every 5 seconds. 
The initialDelaySeconds field tells the kubelet that it should wait 5 seconds before performing the first probe. 

To perform a probe, the kubelet executes the command cat /tmp/healthy in the target container. 
If the command succeeds, it returns 0, and the kubelet considers the container to be alive and healthy. 
If the command returns a non-zero value, the kubelet kills the container and restarts it.
