Digging a bit deeper, a Pod is just a shared execution environment for one or more containers. More often than not, a Pod only has one container.


To deploy a Pod to a Kubernetes cluster we define it in a manifest file and then POST that manifest file to the API server. The master examines it, records it in the cluster store, and the scheduler deploys the Pod to a healthy node with enough available resources.


At the highest level, a Pod is a shared execution environment for one or more containers. “shared execution environment” means that all container in a Pod share the IP address, hostname, sockets, memory, volumes, and more, of the Pod they run inside of.

Each Pod creates its own network namespace - a single IP address, a single range of ports, and a single routing table. This is true even if the Pod is a multicontainer Pod - each container in a Pod shares the Pods IP, range of ports, and routing table.
