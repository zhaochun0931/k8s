The first thing you'll need to configure after you've installed cert-manager is an Issuer or a ClusterIssuer. 
These are resources that represent certificate authorities (CAs) able to sign certificates in response to certificate signing requests.






kubectl apply -f issuer.yml

kubectl apply -f clusterissuer.yml

kubectl apply -f certificate.yml







openssl x509 -in <(kubectl get secret root-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d) -text -noout
