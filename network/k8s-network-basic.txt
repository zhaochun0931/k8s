✅ Without the service, can one pod ping another pod from different deploy?


Yes, but only by using the Pod IP directly — not by Pod name.

Here’s the detailed explanation:

1️⃣ Pods in Kubernetes

Each Pod gets a unique IP from the cluster’s Pod network (CNI plugin assigns subnets).

Pods on the same node usually get IPs from the same /24 subnet.

Pods on different nodes get IPs from their node’s subnet, but routing between nodes is handled by the CNI.
