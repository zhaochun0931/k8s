Kubernetes uses Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugins to manage networking in Kubernetes clusters. CNIs are responsible for assigning IP addresses to pods, network routing between pods, Kubernetes Service routing, and more.




Overlay networks
Overlay networking is the most common networking model used in Kubernetes. In overlay networks, pods are given an IP address from a private, logically separate CIDR from the Azure VNet subnet where AKS nodes are deployed. This allows for simpler and often better scalability than the flat network model.







Flat networks
Unlike an overlay network, a flat network model in AKS assigns IP addresses to pods from a subnet from the same Azure VNet as the AKS nodes. This means that traffic leaving your clusters is not SNAT'd, and the pod IP address is directly exposed to the destination.
