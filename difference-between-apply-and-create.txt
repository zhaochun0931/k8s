✅ Core conceptual difference



✅
kubectl create




Imperative

“Create this resource now”

Fails if the resource already exists

Kubernetes does not track desired state




✅
kubectl apply



Declarative

“Make the cluster match this YAML”

Can create OR update

Kubernetes tracks field ownership & last-applied state
