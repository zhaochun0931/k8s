In Docker, both --mount and -v (or --volume) are used to attach storage to containers, but they differ in syntax, flexibility, and clarity.


-v or --volume (Old Style)
  
This is the older, shorter syntax.
  
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my-image





--mount (New Style)

docker run --mount type=bind,source=/host/path,target=/container/path my-image
