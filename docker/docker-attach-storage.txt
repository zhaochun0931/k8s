In Docker, both --mount and -v (or --volume) are used to attach storage to containers, but they differ in syntax, flexibility, and clarity.


-v or --volume (Old Style)
  
This is the older, shorter syntax.
  
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my-image



# this command will create a new directory called mydata in the current directory if it does not exist and mount it to the /tmp/mydata in the container

docker run -it -v ./mydata:/tmp/mydata alpine

docker run -it -v $(pwd)/mydata:/tmp/mydata alpine











--mount (New Style)

docker run --mount type=bind,source=/host/path,target=/container/path my-image



# you should create the mydata in the host OS
mkdir mydata

docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=./mydata,target=/tmp/mydata alpine

docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/mydata,target=/tmp/mydata alpine
