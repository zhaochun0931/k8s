CoreDNS is a flexible, extensible DNS server that is commonly used in Kubernetes (K8s) clusters to provide DNS resolution services. 


CoreDNS is responsible for resolving DNS queries for services and pods within the Kubernetes cluster. For example, when a pod in the cluster needs to reach another service (like my-service.default.svc.cluster.local), CoreDNS resolves the DNS name to the appropriate IP address of the service
