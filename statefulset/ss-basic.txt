A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes resource used to manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods. Unlike Deployments, StatefulSets are used for applications that require stable identities and persistent storage.

--- StatefulSets can be associated with persistent storage using PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). Each pod gets its own storage that persists beyond the lifecycle of the pod.
--- Pods are created, deleted, or scaled in a defined order. For example, when scaling up, pods are created in ascending order (e.g., web-0 before web-1), and when scaling down, pods are terminated in reverse order.
--- StatefulSets allow you to specify the pod management policy:
OrderedReady (default): Pods are started in order and only when the previous pod is ready.
Parallel: All pods are started in parallel, which is faster but may not be suitable for applications needing order.





Components of a StatefulSet

--- Spec: Defines the desired state of the StatefulSet, including:

Service Name: Name of the headless service used for stable network identity.
Replicas: Number of desired pods.
Selector: Label selector to identify the pods managed by the StatefulSet.
Template: Pod template defining the container specifications.
VolumeClaimTemplates: Specifies the PVCs to be created for each pod.

---PersistentVolumeClaims: Automatically created PVCs for each pod based on the volumeClaimTemplates section.

--- Headless Service: A service without a cluster IP, enabling direct access to the individual pods. This is crucial for maintaining stable network identities.




üß© What is a StatefulSet?

A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is a controller that manages the deployment and scaling of a set of stateful Pods ‚Äî Pods that keep their identity and storage across restarts.

You can think of it as the stateful sibling of a Deployment.




‚öôÔ∏è Why StatefulSet Exists

Normally, when you use a Deployment, your Pods are interchangeable ‚Äî if one dies, another replaces it, but it gets a new name, new IP, and no persistent data unless you use external storage.

That‚Äôs fine for stateless services like Nginx or APIs.

But for databases, GemFire servers, Zookeeper, Kafka, etc., you need:

Stable network identities

Stable storage volumes

Predictable startup/shutdown order

That‚Äôs exactly what StatefulSet provides.

| Feature                        | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stable Pod identity**        | Each Pod gets a persistent name like `gf-server-0`, `gf-server-1`, etc.           |
| **Stable hostname**            | Each Pod gets a DNS entry like `gf-server-0.gf-server.default.svc.cluster.local`. |
| **Stable volume**              | Each Pod gets its own PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) ‚Äî data survives restarts.       |
| **Ordered startup & shutdown** | Pods start and stop in sequence (important for clusters that need order).         |
| **Sticky identity**            | Even if a Pod restarts, it keeps its same ordinal index and PVC.                  |
