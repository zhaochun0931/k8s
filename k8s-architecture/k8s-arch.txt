Control Plane Components 
|--- kube-apiserver
|--- etcd
|--- kube-scheduler
|--- kube-controller-manager
|--- cloud-controller-manager





Node Components 
|--- kubelet
|--- kube-proxy
|--- Container runtime




Kubernetes Services
|--- ClusterIP
|--- NodePort
|--- LoadBalancer
|--- ExternalName


The ClusterIP Service is good for internal-only applications that support other workloads within the cluster. ClusterIP is used by default if you don't explicitly specify a type for a Service.


NodePort creates a port mapping on the underlying node that allows the application to be accessed directly with the node IP address and port.
