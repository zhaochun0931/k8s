kubelet

The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node. The kubelet works in terms of a PodSpec. A PodSpec is a YAML or JSON object that describes a pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms (primarily through the apiserver) and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

Kubernetes Services
|--- ClusterIP
|--- NodePort
|--- LoadBalancer
|--- ExternalName


The ClusterIP Service is good for internal-only applications that support other workloads within the cluster. ClusterIP is used by default if you don't explicitly specify a type for a Service.


NodePort creates a port mapping on the underlying node that allows the application to be accessed directly with the node IP address and port. This means the Service is accessible from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.









Services operate at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), while Ingress works at Layer 7 (HTTP/S).
