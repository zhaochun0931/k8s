The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node. The kubelet works in terms of a PodSpec.


The kubelet is one of the most important components in Kubernetes.
It runs on every node and is responsible for running containers.

✅ What is kubelet?

kubelet = the node agent that makes sure containers are running as expected on a node.

Think of it like this:

The API server tells kubelet:
“Please run this Pod.”

The kubelet uses the container runtime (containerd, Docker, CRI-O) to actually start the containers.

Then it reports status back to the API server:
“Pod is running.”

If kubelet dies → the node becomes NotReady.







✅ 2. Talks to container runtime (containerd, Docker)

kubelet doesn't run containers directly.

It uses the CRI (Container Runtime Interface) to call:

containerd

or CRI-O

or old Docker (deprecated)








kubelet --version
