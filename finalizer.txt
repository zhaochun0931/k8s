In Kubernetes, a finalizer is a cleanup hook that tells Kubernetes:

“Before you delete this object, I need to do some cleanup.”

It’s a safety mechanism to ensure resources are cleaned up gracefully, not abruptly.




✅ Simple explanation

When you delete a resource:

kubectl delete pod mypod




Kubernetes:

Sets a deletionTimestamp

Stops normal operations

Waits for finalizers to finish cleanup

Deletes the object only after finalizers are removed

If a finalizer never finishes → the resource gets stuck in Terminating







✅ Where finalizers live

They are stored in metadata:

metadata:
  finalizers:
    - example.com/my-finalizer
