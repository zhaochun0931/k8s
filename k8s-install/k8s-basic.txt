At the highest level, Kubernetes is an orchestrator of containerized apps. Ideally microservice apps. Microservice app is just a fancy name for an application that’s made up of lots of small and independent parts - we sometimes call these small parts services. 
These small independent services work together to create a meaningful/useful app.


In the real world, a football (soccer) team is made up of individuals. No two are the same, and each has a different role to play in the team. 
Some defend, some attack, some are great at passing, some are great at shooting…. Along comes the coach, and he or she gives everyone a position and organizes them into a team with a plan.
