If you deploy a pod without the service account and list the pods, you will get the following error.






/ # hostname
pod-without-sa
/ #
/ # kubectl get pods
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:default:default" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "default"
/ #


The default service account that gets attached to pods doesnâ€™t have any API access to resources.












if you attach your own SA to this pod, you are able to run the 'kubectl get' command


/ # hostname
pod-with-sa
/ #
/ # kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-with-sa      1/1     Running   0          2m22s
pod-without-sa   1/1     Running   0          110s
/ #












kubectl run pod-without-sa --image=arm64v8/alpine --command sleep -- 24h
