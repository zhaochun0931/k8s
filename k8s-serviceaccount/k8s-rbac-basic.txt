Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

RBAC authorization uses the rbac.authorization.k8s.io API group to drive authorization decisions,




The RBAC API declares four kinds of Kubernetes object: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding.


Role:
An entity that is assigned a set of access permissions within a namespace. Roles require the assignment of a Kubernetes namespace.


Cluster Role:
An entity that is assigned a set of access permissions scoped to the cluster and all of its Kubernetes namespaces. ClusterRoles do not have a namespace assigned.



RoleBinding:
associates a subject with a role. A subject can be a user, a group, or a ServiceAccount. Role binding is used to grant permissions to a subject. 
Role and RoleBinding are used to scope a subject to a specific Kubernetes namespace.



ClusterRoleBinding:
associates a subject with a ClusterRole. A subject can be a user, a group, or a ServiceAccount. 
A ClusterRoleBinding is used to grant permissions to a subject. ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are used to scope a subject's access to the cluster which includes all the Kubernetes namespaces inside the cluster.



Use Role and a RoleBinding to scope security to a single Kubernetes namespace.
Use Role and a RoleBinding to scope security to several Kubernetes namespaces.
Use ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to scope security to all namespaces.
