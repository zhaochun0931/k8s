Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

RBAC authorization uses the rbac.authorization.k8s.io API group to drive authorization decisions,




The RBAC API declares four kinds of Kubernetes object: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding.


Role:
An entity that is assigned a set of access permissions within a namespace. Roles require the assignment of a Kubernetes namespace.


Cluster Role:
An entity that is assigned a set of access permissions scoped to the cluster and all of its Kubernetes namespaces. ClusterRoles do not have a namespace assigned.
